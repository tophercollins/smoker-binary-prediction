# Binary Prediction of Smoker Status using Bio Signals

This project aims to predict the smoker status (smoker or non-smoker) based on biological signals, employing machine learning techniques. The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Below is an overview of the steps taken in this analysis.

## Steps
### Data Preparation
* Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
* Clean the data by removing irrelevant or incomplete records.
* Normalize and standardize the data for machine learning models.
* Split the data into training and testing sets.

### Feature Engineering
* Extract relevant features from the biological signals.
* Analyze the significance of each feature in relation to smoker status.
* Perform feature selection to identify the most predictive variables.

### Model Development
* Train various machine learning models on the dataset.
* Implement techniques like cross-validation for better model evaluation.
* Optimize model parameters for improved accuracy.

### Evaluation
* Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
* Compare different models to identify the most effective one.
* Analyze the misclassifications to understand model limitations.

### Visualization
* Use Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to visualize data distributions and model performance.
* Create confusion matrices and ROC curves for model evaluation.
* Illustrate feature importances and their impact on predictions.

### Save Model
* Save the trained model for future prediction on new data.
* Document the model's performance metrics for reference.

### Conclusion
* This analysis provides a machine learning approach to predict smoker status using biological signals.
* Insights on feature importance and model performance guide future improvements and applications of the model.
* The model can be adapted or expanded to similar classification problems in the biomedical field.
